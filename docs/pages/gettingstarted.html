Welcome to B10ggy! A simple SSG for creating simple blogs and websites like the one your are on now. Asumming you had already read the <a href="https://github.com/gamemake-eng/B10ggy">readme</a>, lets create our first project! It's really easy to get up and running, just open up a command prompt and run <code>path/to/bloggy.exe create [project name]</code> and it should create a simple project for you! Lets look at the settings.json file.

<code>
{
		//The "posts" setting is where you put in all of the posts on your site (required)
		"posts":[
			//These are the minimal required settings for each post. Every post
			{
				"body":"Welcome to your new B10ggy project! You can replace this text with a filename!",
				"title":"Hello World"
			}
			//To make a new post you just copy and paste the above (dont forget to add a comma to the end of the last item)
		],
		//This is where you point to the directory of the homepage skeleton
		"homepage_template":"home.html",
		"post_template":"post.html",
		"author":"You",
		"blog":"testproject"
}
